# Vet clinic database: query multiple tables

> In this part of the project, we added some new tables and also foreign key columns to our existing animals' table to model one-to-many relationships. In addition, we used the `JOIN` statement to query the data.

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**

## Results

- Write queries (using `JOIN`) to answer the following questions:
  - What animals belong to Melody Pond?
  - List of all animals that are pokemon (their type is Pokemon).
  - List all owners and their animals, remember to include those that don't own any animal.
  - How many animals are there per species?
  - List all Digimon owned by Jennifer Orwell.
  - List all animals owned by Dean Winchester that haven't tried to escape.
  - Who owns the most animals?
