# Vet clinic database: query multiple tables

> In this part of the project, we added some **many-to-many** relationships and wrote more complex queries to answer questions.

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**

## Results

- Write queries to answer the following:
  - Who was the last animal seen by William Tatcher?
  - How many different animals did Stephanie Mendez see?
  - List all vets and their specialties, including vets with no specialties.
  - List all animals that visited Stephanie Mendez between April 1st and August 30th, 2020.
  - What animal has the most visits to vets?
  - Who was Maisy Smith's first visit?
  - Details for most recent visit: animal information, vet information, and date of visit.
  - How many visits were with a vet that did not specialize in that animal's species?
  - What specialty should Maisy Smith consider getting? Look for the species she gets the most.
